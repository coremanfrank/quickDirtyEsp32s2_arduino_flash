to be integrated into a project created using the ESP-IDF and built using the ESP-IDF build system. 
The project would need to include all necessary components and dependencies, such as the GPIO driver and the SPIFFS filesystem. 
You can create a new project using the ESP-IDF and then copy the provided code into the appropriate source file in the project.

As for the CMake files, they are used to control the build process and provide information about the project to the build system. 
You will typically find CMakeLists.txt files in the root directory of your project and in each directory containing source code.
The ESP-IDF provides a set of CMake macros that simplify the process of building and configuring ESP32 projects, so you don't need to worry about creating the CMake files from scratch. 
You just need to include the ESP-IDF cmake macros in your project and then use the idf.py build command to build the project

Here is an example of a simple bash script that can be used to create a new ESP-IDF project, copy the provided code into the project, and build the project:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set up the ESP-IDF
export IDF_PATH=/path/to/esp-idf

# Create a new project
idf.py new my_project

# Copy the provided code into the project
cp /path/to/flash_hex.c my_project/main

# Build the project
idf.py build
